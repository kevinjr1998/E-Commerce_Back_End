# E-Commerce Back End

## Task
This task was to build the back end for an e-commerce site. This involved using Sequelize and the Express.js API to interact with our MySQL database. Our database consists of 4 tables: Categories, Products and Tags, as well as a ProductTag table for our association between the Products and Tags tables. We can make various request to our server to add, delete and update various entries within the Products, Tags and Categories tables, by sending `GET`, `PUT` and `DELETE` requests to the server. 

## Install
To install, navigate to the `db` folder and log into the MySQL Shell, and type `source schema.sql`. Then log out and naviaget back to the root of the application. Then type `npm i` to install dependencies, then `npm run seed` to seed the database. After this you can type `npm run start` to start the server.
